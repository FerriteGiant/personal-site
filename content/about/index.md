<img width="160px" class="about-image" src="/img/me.jpg" alt="This is me" /> 
I classify  my intellectual pursuits as either *"Trying to make math behave like the universe"* or *"Trying to make the universe behave like math."* 

The former is exemplified by my love of physics, and the later by my fascination with electrical engineering  and computer science.
