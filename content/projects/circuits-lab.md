Teaching circuits to undergrads.
<!--more-->

I taught the circuits course for physics undergrads at LSU twice, the first time as a grad student and the second as an instructor. I really enjoyed teaching this lab, partly because I learned so much myself. 

The second year, I did a complete rewrite of all the labs. Below are links to the full labs and summaries of what was covered in each lab. 

#### Lab 1 - Instrumentation and Measurements [(pdf)](/projects/circuit-lab/PHYS_3098_Lab_01_Instrumentation.pdf)

<img width="150px" class="lab-image"  src="/projects/circuit-lab/scope.png">


Using a multimeter without letting the magic smoke out of the fuse, operating a variable DC power supply and a function generator, building circuits on breadboards, voltage divider circuits, and proper oscilloscope usage. Ends with a discussion of uncertainty and propagation thereof. 


#### Lab 2 - Input and Output Impedance [(pdf)](/projects/circuit-lab/PHYS_3098_Lab_02_Impedance.pdf)
<img width="150px" class="lab-image"  src="/projects/circuit-lab/thevenin.svg">

Measure the input impedance of a voltmeter and an oscilloscope, and observe the effects of measurement equipment loading a circuit. Analyze resistive and capacitive voltage dividers. Measure the output impedance of a function generator.

#### Lab 3 - RC Circuits [(pdf)](/projects/circuit-lab/PHYS_3098_Lab_03_RC_Circuits.pdf)
<img width="150px" class="lab-image"  src="/projects/circuit-lab/impedance.svg">

Measure the time constant of charging and discharging RC circuits. Derive RC circuit voltages using complex analysis and use this to build integrator and differentiator circuits with outputs accurate to within 1%. I recorded a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAsnk1Yj4u8) showing an example derivation.
